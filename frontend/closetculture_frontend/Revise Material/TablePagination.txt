** Understanding MUI Table Pagination:

1. handleChangePage Magic Trick 🎩✨

const handleChangePage = (event, newPage) => {
  setPage(newPage); 
};

Why It Works Without Passing Args:

Invisible Handshake 🤝:
MUI's TablePagination component automatically passes two arguments when it calls this function:
event: The click event (you can ignore it if not needed)
newPage: The page number you're switching to

When you click "next page", MUI sends the new page number as the second argument,even if you didn't use the first argument you have to give it,
or else it always takes the one argument you gave as the first argument kanaku which is event object.

Like a Vending Machine 🥤:
// MUI does this internally:
handleChangePage(automaticallyGeneratedEvent, clickedPageNumber);

Brain Stamp 🏷️:
"It's like your friend handing you a drink - you didn't ask for it, but they automatically give it when you're thirsty!"

2. setRowsPerPage Decoded 🔢➡️🔟

const handleChangeRowsPerPage = (event) => {
  setRowsPerPage(parseInt(event.target.value, 10));
  setPage(0); // Reset to first page
};

Breakdown:
event.target.value:

Comes from the dropdown <select>

Example: If you pick "25 rows", value is "25" (as string)

parseInt(string, 10):
Converts string "25" → number 25
10 means "use decimal system" (always use this)

Why reset to page 0?:
If you were on page 5 of 10-per-page, switching to 25-per-page might make page 5 invalid
Like starting a new notebook 📒 - go back to first page!

----> [You click page 3] → [MUI whispers (event, 3) to handler] → [page=3]
----> [You select "25"] → [Dropdown gives "25" as string] 
      → [parseInt makes it number 25] 
      → [Rows updated, back to page 1]
