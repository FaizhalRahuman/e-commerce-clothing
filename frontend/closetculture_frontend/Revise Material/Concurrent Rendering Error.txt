Faiz Undertanding:

lets say we have this code:

useEffect(() => {
    if (!prdId || deleted) return;

    const deleteProduct = async () => {
        try {
            const res = await fetchDeleteData(`/product/delete-by-id/${prdId}`);
            console.log("Successfully Product Deleted:", res.data);
            setDeleted(true);
            navigate('/admin/home');

        } catch (err) {
            
            setPrdError(err.response?.data || "Unexpected Error");
            console.error("Error While Deleting Product in ProdDeleteById.js", err.message);
        }
    };

    deleteProduct();

}, [prdId, deleted]);

Now Undertand one thing, 
        when React renders a component,React will stop the current render in a mid-way(pathilaiye) someTimes and start a fresh render again.

Now in this situation,if the react stops the first render it made and starts a new render the firs rendered useeffect() or functions() are still
running in the background, so in this place,
const deleteProduct = async () => {
        try {
            const res = await fetchDeleteData(`/product/delete-by-id/${prdId}`);
            console.log("Successfully Product Deleted:", res.data);
            setDeleted(true);
            navigate('/admin/home');

        } catch (err) {
            
            setPrdError(err.response?.data || "Unexpected Error");
            console.error("Error While Deleting Product in ProdDeleteById.js", err.message);
        }
    };

if it stops the first render and then start a new render ,but this delete product still running in background and after the api call finishes,it 
does move to the setDelete() and navigate() ,when this setDelete() and navigate() happens ,React gets confused,it'll be like:"hey!! i already unmount
or stpo that render(component) but why you try to setDelete(setState like thing)/navigate(),i'm currently on this new render,here only that should be happened
in this component!!! why it happening in unmounted component"--> it gets confused and throw this error -->There was an error during concurrent rendering but React was able to recover by instead synchronously rendering the entire root.

So,we fix it by using some logic(we can say "ignore" logic)

let ignore = false;

useEffect(() => {
  if (!prdId || deleted) return;

  const deleteProduct = async () => {
    const res = await fetchDeleteData(...); // ⏳ async
    if (!ignore) {
      setDeleted(true);
      navigate('/admin/home');
    }
  };

  deleteProduct(); // 🔄 Async call starts...

  return () => {
    ignore = true; // 🛑 Cleanup — mark as invalid
  };
}, [prdId, deleted]);

Here, we mark ignore as false and and also say that this setDeleted(true); , navigate('/admin/home'); happens only if the ignore is false,so asusual the deleteProduct()
func is called and api call is go and if the react unmount or stop this component,
This,
  return () => {
    ignore = true; // 🛑 Cleanup — mark as invalid
  };

happens(it happens when the component gets unmount/reRender remember it).So now our problem is cleared,if react unmount the first render then this "return" called and
we make the ignore as false inside it and after react drops and rerender the component fresh and even the function is running on background,it won't get into the 
setDeleted(true); ,navigate('/admin/home'); because it only runs if ignore is false but we made the ognore as true when component unmount,so this setState thing and 
navigate didn't get executed and the problem won't happens(React won't get confused)->DOESNOT THROW ERROR.

DETAILED EXPLANATION:
CHAT:

❓ PROBLEM: Why error without ignore, but works with ignore?

⚡ Direct Answer:
When React renders a component, it may start rendering it, but cancel it midway (like during transitions or strict mode).
But your useEffect still tries to update state (setDeleted, setPrdError) even though that render was cancelled.
➡️ This causes errors like:
“Concurrent rendering error but React recovered...”

🔥 Reason ignore = true works:

You are using:

return () => {
  ignore = true;
};

That’s a cleanup function in useEffect.
React calls this cleanup if the effect is about to re-run or the component unmounts.
when useEffect is about to re-run again due to dependency change

So:
If ignore = true, it means “don’t call setState now, this render is no longer active.”

✅ So even if React cancels that render midway, your async function will not do setDeleted() or navigate() or setPrdError().
No state update → No error.


✅ So When Should You Use ignore?
Let’s list the places where ignore is important, based on real cases:

💎 Golden Rule To Remember
❗️If your useEffect has await / async work, always add a cleanup (like ignore) to avoid updates on unmounted components.

🔍 1. 🔄 React Can Unmount a Component at Any Time When:
React may unmount your component in several cases — not because of setState, but because you (or React Router) caused the component to leave the screen.
 ---> Navigation like things.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
❗ When would ignore logic  be needed?

pending:::::::::::

Only when:
You have long async chains (await, .then() with delays).

You're dong setState(...) inside those.

You want to prevent memory leaks or warnings like: "Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component"

If We didn't use setState(...) inside those (await, .then() with delays)

we can simply use  ----- > useRef();

Which can handle the Multiple Deletion Error Occured and this cuncurrent rendr also.
