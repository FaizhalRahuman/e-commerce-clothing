✅ 1. MainRoutes Object Configuration (Declarative Routing Configuration)

const DeleteAlbumPage = Loadable(lazy(() => import('pages/albums/deleteAlbum')));

const MainRoutes = {
  path: '/',
  element: <MainLayout />,
  children: [
    {
      path: '',
      element: <AlbumsPage />
    },
    {
      path: 'delete-album',
      element: <DeleteAlbumPage />
    }
  ]
};

🔍 Explanation:

This is an object-based routing configuration (often used with frameworks like react-router-config or libraries built on top of React Router).
It allows you to define nested routes in a structured tree, which can be processed programmatically.
You can pass this config to custom routing functions or loop over it to generate routes.
Useful for large applications with deeply nested layouts, tabs, or dynamically generated routes.

💡 When to Use:
Complex apps with nested routing.
Centralized route management (route guards, permissions, layout control).
Reusable route trees (e.g., using with <useRoutes()> in React Router v6+).

✅ 2. Direct JSX-Based Routing (Imperative JSX Routing)

import Home from '../pages/Home';

const AppRoutes = () => {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path='/' element={<Home />} />
    </Routes>
  );
};

🔍 Explanation:

This is the standard way of declaring routes using JSX components from React Router v6+.
Easy to understand and intuitive for small to medium-sized apps.
Routes are defined in-line and rendered directly via <Routes> and <Route> tags.
Provides full control of each route's structure in JSX.

💡 When to Use:

Small to medium projects.
Simple routing with few pages.
You prefer declarative and direct JSX-based definitions.
When not using dynamic layouts or metadata.
