🔍 Object.entries(obj) — What Does It Return?

const obj = {
  a: "apple",
  b: "banana"
};

console.log(Object.entries(obj));

👉 It returns:
[
  ['a', 'apple'],
  ['b', 'banana']
]

Each item is an array with 2 elements → [key, value]


🧠 So When You Do: Object.entries(obj).map(([key, value]) => ...)

✅ You're saying:

“Hey JavaScript, for each inner array like ['a', 'apple'], please unpack it into key and value.”

❌ What Happens If You Remove the Square Brackets?

When you do:  Object.entries(obj).map((key, value) => ...)

Here’s what goes wrong:
map() passes only 1 argument — the array ['a', 'apple']
But you're asking for two: key and value

So:
key = ['a', 'apple'] ✅
value = ❌ undefined

Result:

{key} → becomes ['a', 'apple'], which when converted to string becomes "a,apple"

navigate(value) → value is undefined → doesn't navigate!
